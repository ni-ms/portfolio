		Yo! I'm Nikhil, and I am designer and software developer. I love working on tech in a creative way to build stuff
		that matters.
		<br />
		<br />
		Im always trying to discover the latest in technology, and recently I’ve been learning Rust. When I’m not
		coding, you might catch me with my nose in a book—currently reading“The 48-Hour Startup”—or enjoying some tunes
		while hitting the gym.
		<br />
		<br />
		Ever since I was a kid, I’ve enjoyed tinkering with tech and electronics and figuring out how they work. This led me
		to learn Python and start web development. I’ve always enjoyed having a creative outlet in whatever I do, whether
		it’s playing an
		instrument, creating digital art, or designing and developing innovative apps.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you’re looking for someone who combines creativity with
		technical skill, that’s me. Stick around, and let’s make something awesome together.
